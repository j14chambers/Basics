# Basics

## 1. Basic Webpage Layout

An webpage with a navigation bar, header and body. There is no real information being used, just some dummy text.

### Colors:

Mint Cream - #f7fff7

Gray Web - #7d7c7a

Space Cadet - #2f3061

Orange Crayola - #ff7733

Honey Yellow - #f7b32b

### Font:

**Headers:**

font-family: 'Antonio', sans-serif;

**Paragraph, links and captions:**

font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;

## Notes:

The hardest thing was remembering how to use flexbox. It has been awhile since I last used it. Even then it was hard to remember how the layouts work.

## 2. Flexbox

### Colors:

Gray Web - #7d7c7a

White

Black

## Notes:

Same font-family from webpage 1; Followed a tutorial before starting this web page. There were still some problems with the navigation bar, but everything else was good. There are more notes in Figma on Flexbox.

## 3. Postioning

Learning how to use positioning outside of flexbox and css grid with relative, static, sticky, and fixed.

## Notes:

Random colors for background-color.

I don't see how to make a webpage out of this. Other than sticky and fixed, the others don't really serve a purpose when using flex box.

## 4. Flexbox with Positioning

Making an webpage that has a different layout. Maybe having some items float to the left or right on their own.

## 5. Basic Layouts

Take everything so far and make info cards for how to use CSS. Also can be CSS and HTML tips

- When the CSS is finished for the header and footer, add to all pages.
- Fix the CSS for the Header and links
